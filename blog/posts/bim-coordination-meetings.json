They are where the project team comes together to review the federated model, identify and resolve clashes, and make critical decisions about the design and construction of the building. A well-run coordination meeting can save a project a significant amount of time and money by preventing errors and rework on site.</p>\n<p>However, a poorly run meeting can be a waste of everyone's time. In this post, we will provide a step-by-step guide to running effective BIM coordination meetings that will help you to keep your project on track and on budget.</p>\n\n<h2>The Agenda for a Successful BIM Coordination Meeting</h2>\n<p>At ASISA, we have a proven process for running effective BIM coordination meetings. The following flowchart illustrates our agenda for a successful meeting:</p>\n\n<div class=\"mermaid\">\ngraph TD\n    A[Step 1: Pre-Meeting Preparation] --> B(Step 2: Review of Previous Action Items);\n    B --> C{Step 3: Live Model Review & Clash Detection};\n    C --> D[Step 4: Issue Resolution & Task Assignment];\n    D --> E(Step 5: Review of New Action Items);\n    E --> F[Step 6: Post-Meeting Follow-Up];\n\n    subgraph The Anatomy of an Effective Meeting\n        direction LR\n        A -- Sets the Stage --> B;\n        B -- Provides Context --> C;\n        C -- Drives Discussion --> D;\n        D -- Creates Accountability --> E;\n        E -- Confirms Understanding --> F;\n    end\n</div>\n\n<h3>A Step-by-Step Guide to Effective BIM Coordination Meetings:</h3>\n<ol>\n    <li><strong>Pre-Meeting Preparation:</strong> The key to a successful meeting is preparation. Before the meeting, the BIM coordinator should federate the latest models from all disciplines, run a clash detection test, and prepare a clash report. The agenda and the clash report should be distributed to the project team at least 24 hours before the meeting.</li>\n    <li><strong>Review of Previous Action Items:</strong> At the beginning of the meeting, review the action items from the previous meeting. This will help to ensure that all issues are being addressed in a timely manner and that nothing falls through the cracks.</li>\n    <li><strong>Live Model Review & Clash Detection:</strong> The majority of the meeting should be spent reviewing the federated model in a live 3D environment. The BIM coordinator should walk the team through the clash report, and the team should work together to identify the root cause of each clash and to determine the best solution.</li>\n    <li><strong>Issue Resolution & Task Assignment:</strong> Once a solution has been agreed upon, the BIM coordinator should assign a task to a specific team member to resolve the issue. The task should be clearly defined, and a deadline should be set.</li>\n    <li><strong>Review of New Action Items:</strong> At the end of the meeting, the BIM coordinator should review the new action items with the team to ensure that everyone is clear on their responsibilities.</li>\n    <li><strong>Post-Meeting Follow-Up:</strong> After the meeting, the BIM coordinator should distribute the meeting minutes and the updated action item list to the project team. The BIM coordinator should also follow up with team members to ensure that all action items are completed on time.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<h2>Your Partner in BIM Coordination</h2>\n<p>At ASISA, we have a team of experienced BIM coordinators who can help you to run effective BIM coordination meetings that will keep your project on track and on budget.
