    "content": "<h2>What is ISO 19650?</h2>\n<p>ISO 19650 is an international standard for managing information over the whole life cycle of a built asset using building information modelling (BIM). It provides a framework for managing information, including its exchange, and is applicable to organizations of all sizes and complexities in the construction industry.</p>\n<p>In simple terms, ISO 19650 helps ensure that the right people have the right information at the right time. This is crucial for avoiding errors, reducing rework, and ensuring that projects are delivered on time and within budget.</p>\n\n<h2>Key Principles of ISO 19650</h2>\n<p>ISO 19650 is based on a set of key principles that are designed to promote a collaborative and structured approach to information management.</p>\n<h3>1. Common Data Environment (CDE)</h3>\n<p>The CDE is a central repository where all project information is stored. This ensures that everyone on the project team is working from the latest information and that there is a single source of truth. At ASISA, we have experience in setting up and managing CDEs for projects of all sizes, ensuring that information flows seamlessly between all stakeholders.</p>\n<h3>2. Information Requirements</h3>\n<p>ISO 19650 emphasizes the importance of clearly defining the information requirements for a project. This includes specifying what information is needed, who is responsible for providing it, and when it is needed. This helps to ensure that the right information is produced and that it meets the needs of the project.</p>\n<h3>3. Collaborative Working</h3>\n<p>Collaboration is at the heart of ISO 19650. The standard promotes a collaborative approach to information management, where all members of the project team work together to produce and share information. This helps to break down silos and ensure that everyone is working towards a common goal.</p>\n\n<h2>Benefits of Implementing ISO 19650</h2>\n<p>Implementing ISO 19650 can bring a wide range of benefits to your construction projects, including:</p>\n<ul>\n    <li><strong>Improved Collaboration:</strong> By providing a common framework for information management, ISO 19650 helps to improve collaboration among all project stakeholders.</li>\n    <li><strong>Reduced Rework:</strong> With a single source of truth and clear information requirements, you can significantly reduce the risk of errors and rework.</li>\n    <li><strong>Increased Efficiency:</strong> A structured approach to information management can help to streamline your workflows and improve the overall efficiency of your projects.</li>\n    <li><strong>Enhanced Quality:</strong> By ensuring that the right information is available to the right people at the right time, you can improve the quality of your decision-making and the overall quality of your projects.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h2>How ASISA Can Help</h2>\n<p>Implementing ISO 19650 can seem like a daunting task, but you don't have to do it alone.
